## [Unreleased]

### Flagship game
- **ZOMBOID** (`apps/zomboid`) — a top-down twin-stick zombie **shooter** whose entire simulation is
  written in `maz::script` and driven on a `scene::SceneTree`. Mouse-aim + hold-to-fire pulls rounds
  from an object-pooled bullet system (a script can't spawn nodes, so bullets and zombies are fixed
  pools the scripts activate/recycle); zombies have health and die; a wave Director spawns endless,
  escalating hordes on a ring; loot, hunger→health survival pressure, and the day/night rage ramp
  remain. Score / wave / kills HUD, a hurt-tint on wounded zombies, an aim tracer and crosshair.
  100% of the rules are verified headless in CI; the render app steps a deterministic fixed timestep
  under `--headless`/`--frames` (a 30 s autopilot run reaches wave 4 / 36 kills with no GPU).
- **Weapons** — three switchable guns (1/2/3): pistol (accurate), shotgun (6-pellet spread, slow),
  and SMG (fast, weaker), each with its own fire rate, damage, spread and bullet speed; the shotgun
  fires a real pellet burst in one shot. Verified headless (`tests/zomboid/sim.cpp`, ctest
  `zomboid_sim`): pools build, wave 1 auto-spawns, firing respects each weapon's cadence, the shotgun
  emits a 6-bullet burst, the SMG out-shoots the pistol over a second, a bullet kills a zombie and
  scores, cleared waves escalate, and survival/loot still hold. Kept as its own fast-compiling target
  so game iterations verify in a second instead of rebuilding the full unit suite.
- **Enemy variety** — four zombie kinds with distinct stats, sprites and sizes: walkers (baseline),
  runners (fast, fragile), brutes (slow, tanky, big, hard-hitting) and a boss that leads every 5th
  wave. The Director mixes kinds into each wave (runners from wave 2, brutes from wave 3); tougher
  kinds award more score, and bullet hit tests use each body's radius so big enemies are easier to
  hit. Verified headless: a forced wave 5 spawns a boss (HP > 300) plus a genuine runner/brute/walker
  mix with runners out-pacing and brutes out-tanking walkers, and a brute survives a single pistol
  shot. Autopilot 45 s run reaches wave 5 (a boss wave).
- **Impact juice** — a script-side particle pool (sparks on every hit, a blood burst on a kill) and a
  decaying screen-shake value that the camera reads (bigger kicks for brutes and bosses), plus an
  app-side muzzle flash. The simulation core is verified headless (`zomboid_sim`): the particle pool
  builds, a kill emits particles and raises `g_shake`, and both ease back to rest within a couple of
  seconds. The muzzle flash and camera shake render on the app side (owner-visible on real hardware).
- **Ammo + reload** — each weapon has a magazine, a reserve, a capacity and a reload time (pistol
  12/48, shotgun 6/24, SMG 30/90). A shot spends one round; emptying the magazine auto-reloads (or
  press R), and switching weapons cancels a reload. Loot doubles as an ammo crate, topping up every
  weapon's reserve. The HUD shows `AMMO mag / reserve` and a RELOADING indicator. Verified headless
  (`zomboid_sim`): firing drains the magazine and an auto-reload refills it from a diminished reserve;
  a weapon with an empty magazine and empty reserve fires exactly its last round then goes dry and
  cannot reload; and collecting loot raises the reserve.
- **Between-wave upgrades** — surviving a wave grants a permanent upgrade, cycling +20% damage, +15%
  fire rate, +25 max health (with a full heal), and an ammo top-up. Damage and fire rate are applied
  as multipliers over each weapon's base stats, so the whole arsenal scales together as the run goes
  on. The HUD shows the upgrade count and current DMG/RATE multipliers. Verified headless
  (`zomboid_sim`): each `apply_upgrade` raises the matching stat in turn, and clearing wave 1 hands out
  the first upgrade exactly when wave 2 opens (none before).
- **Grenades** — a throwable, object-pooled explosive (start with 3, press G): it flies along the aim,
  slows, and after a short fuse detonates, damaging every zombie inside the blast radius plus a burst
  of blood and screen-shake. Loot tops one up. The HUD shows the grenade count. Verified headless
  (`zomboid_sim`): the pool builds, throwing spends exactly one and arms a grenade, a detonation in the
  middle of a three-zombie cluster kills all three at once, throwing with none left does nothing, and
  loot refills a grenade.
- **Combo multiplier** — fast, unbroken kills build a score multiplier (+1× every 5 kills in the
  streak, capped at 5×) that decays after ~2.5 s without a kill, rewarding aggressive play. Each kill
  scores `score_value × multiplier`. The HUD flashes the live combo. Verified headless (`zomboid_sim`)
  against a hand-computed total: five back-to-back walker kills reach a 5-streak / 2× and score exactly
  60 (four at 1× + one at 2×), and the streak resets to 1× after the window elapses with no kills.
- **Persistent high score + restart** — the best run (best wave + best score) is saved to the platform
  pref dir via `core::KeyValueStore` and shown on the HUD; on death the game saves a new best (flagging
  "NEW BEST!") and offers "PRESS ENTER TO RESTART", which rebuilds a fresh SceneTree for a clean run.
  Verified headless (`zomboid_sim`): `beatsBest` ranks runs correctly (score primary, wave tiebreak),
  and a best written through `KeyValueStore.save()` reloads intact.
- **Health medkits** — a slain zombie has a ~12% chance to drop a medkit; walk over it to heal 40
  (capped at max health). Kits are an object pool, blink as they near expiry, and vanish if ignored,
  giving a reason to push into danger for a top-up. Verified headless (`zomboid_sim`): the pool builds,
  `drop_medkit` activates a kit, walking onto it heals and consumes it, the heal is capped at max, and
  an ignored kit expires.
- **Exploder zombies** — a fifth zombie kind (from wave 4): a fast, fragile suicide bomber that
  detonates when killed, dealing area-of-effect damage to the survivor if they are within ~5 units,
  so it must be shot from a distance rather than let close. The blast throws extra particles and a
  bigger screen-shake, and the Director folds exploders into the mix on later waves. Verified headless
  (`zomboid_sim`): a spawned exploder is faster and more fragile than a walker, dying next to the
  survivor drains their health while an identical exploder dying far away does not, and a forced wave 4
  actually contains an exploder.
- **Sound effects** — procedural SFX (`audio::Audio`) for gunfire (per-weapon pitch), zombie deaths,
  reloads, grenade/boss booms, wave starts, taking a bite, and dying. The app fires one-shots by
  watching simulation state change frame-to-frame — no script hooks needed — and resyncs on restart so
  a fresh run stays silent until it acts. Audio degrades gracefully with no device (headless smoke
  runs clean, exit 0); the sound is owner-audible on real hardware.

### Scripting & scene
- `maz::script` — a from-scratch, header-only scripting language (the GDScript competitor): values,
  collections, stdlib+RNG, closures, classes + inheritance + `super`, host binding + lifecycle,
  signals + deferred dispatch, safety budgets + stack traces, hot reload, gradual typing, modules +
  introspection + debugger hooks.
- `scene::SceneTree` / `SceneNode` — unified node hierarchy with 2D transform composition, attached
  scripts, groups, path lookup, and `get_node`/`has_node` script natives; plus `.tscn`-style
  text serialization (`scene::saveTree`/`loadTree`).

### Asset pipeline
- `core::AssetServer<T>` — asynchronous threaded loading with status/progress, dedup + ref-counting,
  and stamp-based reimport / hot reload (Godot's `ResourceLoader` threaded API).

### Infrastructure
- `platform::CrashHandler` — fatal-signal backtrace dump to stderr + a crash-log file, with symbol
  demangling (Godot's `CrashHandler`).
- `tools/package.sh` — one-command self-contained game export with a launch-verify step (Godot's
  "Export Project").
- API docs: `tools/gen_api_docs.py` → `docs/API.md` (144 headers) + a `Doxyfile`.
- `core::Telemetry` — opt-in, privacy-first analytics buffer (off by default, no built-in network
  transport, JSONL, no PII).

### Core systems
- `core::Replay<T>` — deterministic input record/replay with RLE serialization.
- `core::Checkpoints` — named save slots + a rolling rewind ring (rewind mechanics / rollback).
- `core::LinearArena` + `core::PoolAllocator` — frame arena + fixed-size pool allocators.
- `core::SmallVector<T,N>` + `core::SparseSet<T>` — inline-buffer vector + O(1) sparse set.
- `core::TypeDesc<T>` — minimal, type-safe reflection (member-pointer props + serialize).
- `core::DateTime` + `core::GameClock` — deterministic epoch↔calendar + in-game clock.
- `core::Version` — semantic version type (parse/compare) + build macros.

### Spatial & IO
- `game::Quadtree` + `game::Octree` — 2D/3D bounded-region spatial partitioning for broadphase
  culling and range queries.
- `io::VirtualFileSystem` — `res://` / `user://` scheme paths with normalization and a
  traversal-escape guard.

### Build & CI
- Cross-platform GitHub Actions CI (Linux build+test; macOS/Windows unit tests).
- Builds pass `-rdynamic` so crash backtraces resolve symbols.

_This project is under active development toward parity-or-better with the Godot game engine. Where a
capability can't be matched honestly (e.g. platform-specific packaging, GPU features requiring a real
device), it is documented as pending rather than claimed._

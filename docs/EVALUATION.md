# Maz Engine — Evaluation & Enhancement Backlog

A living document driving the autonomous improvement loop: evaluate the engine, list what to add,
implement it, then re-evaluate and repeat. Updated each iteration.

## Where the engine stands (after M21)

**Strong:**
- Clean layered architecture (`core ← platform ← render ← game/app`), pluggable `Renderer`.
- 2D: batched sprites, multi-camera, TrueType HUD text, tilemaps, 2D particles.
- 3D: textured meshes, depth, shadow mapping (PCF), gradient sky, MSAA, **point lights**.
- Assets: glTF **model** and **scene** loading (cgltf) with embedded base-color textures.
- Systems: fixed-timestep loop, sparse-set ECS, synth audio, save (KeyValueStore), AABB collision,
  fly camera.
- Three complete sample games (`orbs`, `world`, `village`/VILLAGE QUEST) + 5 demos.
- Verifies headless (lavapipe + Xvfb), 8 ctest smoke tests, warnings-as-error clean.

**Gaps (candidate work):**
1. Atmosphere: distance **fog**; **day/night** with a dynamic sky.
2. Input breadth: **gamepad / controller** support + action mapping.
3. Rendering quality: **bloom / tonemap** post-processing (needs render-to-texture); **normal
   mapping**; **spot lights**; fog.
4. Effects: **3D (world-space) particles** — current particles are 2D only.
5. Performance: **frustum culling**; instanced rendering.
6. Content/tools: native scene serialization; a simple in-game debug overlay.
7. Animation: skeletal animation (glTF skins) — large.

## Iteration log

### Iteration 1 — "Atmosphere & Input" (in progress)
- [x] **M22 — Distance fog** (engine): exponential fog to a fog color by camera distance, in the
  mesh path; fog params in the lights UBO, camera position threaded via `setCameraPosition` +
  push constant. Off by default (density 0) so existing apps are unchanged; `world` and `village`
  opt in so distance fades into the sky.
- [x] **M23 — Gamepad support** (platform): SDL3 gamepad in `platform::Input` (sticks, buttons,
  triggers, deadzone) with hotplug + graceful absence; `world`/`village` movement + look use the
  sticks (world uses triggers for up/down).
- [x] **M24 — Day/night dynamic sky** (engine+app): the sky's zenith/horizon/ground colors + sun
  are now driven by `SceneLighting` (defaults reproduce the old sky); `village` animates a ~48s
  sun arc so the sky, ambient, fog, and warm house lamps shift from bright noon to lamp-lit night.

**Iteration 1 complete.**

### Iteration 2 — "Lighting depth" (complete)
- [x] **M25 — Spot lights**: point lights gained an optional cone (spot axis + inner/outer angle,
  packed into the lights UBO; omni by default). A cool-white searchlight sweeps the village square
  at night — verified as a crisp cone pool distinct from the warm lamps.

### Iteration 3 — in progress
- [x] **M26 — Normal mapping**: derivative-based TBN in mesh.frag (no vertex-format change) + a
  set=3 normal sampler with a flat default (un-mapped meshes unchanged); the loader decodes glTF
  `normalTexture`; the house/village generators bake a normal-map atlas from a height field; model
  + village bind it. Verified: the brick walls and roof shingles now show per-pixel relief.
- [x] **M27 — Bloom / post-processing**: the scene now renders into an offscreen sceneColor
  (MSAA resolves there, SHADER_READ), and a composite pass runs a `PostProcess` fullscreen shader
  that samples it and writes the swapchain — threshold gaussian bloom, passthrough at strength 0.
  Landed incrementally (offscreen+passthrough verified pixel-identical for orbs/cube first, then
  bloom). Village scales bloom with the day/night cycle; night lamps + coins glow. Deferred within
  post: HDR float target + separable multi-pass blur + tonemap operator.
- [x] **M28 — World-space 3D particles**: a `Particles3D` renderer draws camera-facing additive
  billboards (expanded along the camera basis in the vertex shader, radial-falloff soft dots),
  depth-tested against the scene but not depth-writing, inside the scene pass. `Renderer` gains
  `setCameraBasis` + `drawParticle3D`. Village adds a bonfire ember plume that glows and blooms at
  night. Verified on lavapipe.
- [ ] Frustum culling; native scene serialization + a debug stats overlay; GPU-simulated particles.

### Iteration 4 — in progress
- [x] **M28 — World-space 3D particles** (bonfire embers).
- [x] **M29 — Debug stats overlay**: `Renderer::renderStats()` reports per-frame mesh/particle/
  sprite counts; `ui::DebugOverlay` draws smoothed FPS + frame-ms + those counts via the font
  (F3 toggles it in `world`). Verified: the overlay reads live stats on lavapipe.

### Iteration 5 — "Performance & juice" (in progress)
Evaluation found the mesh path draws all geometry unconditionally (no culling) and coin pickups
have no feedback effect. This iteration:
- [x] **M30 — Frustum culling**: each mesh gets a local AABB at upload; `flush` extracts the 6
  frustum planes from viewProj and skips meshes whose world AABB is fully outside. `renderStats`
  gains a `culled` count shown in the overlay. Verified in `world`: "MESH 36 (culled 51)" — >50%
  of draws skipped with the visible scene unchanged.
- [x] **M31 — Pickup-burst particles**: collecting a village coin spawns a 24-spark golden burst
  (short-lived pooled sparks integrated with gravity), drawn via Particles3D — they glow and bloom.
  Verified: the collect moment now sprays fading sparkles.

**Iteration 5 complete** (frustum culling + pickup juice).

### Iteration 6 — "Effects & polish" (in progress)
Evaluation: Particles3D only does additive blending (no smoke/dust); text centering is hand-rolled
in apps. This iteration:
- [x] **M32 — Alpha-blended smoke particles**: Particles3D gained a second pipeline + vertex list
  for alpha over-blending; `drawParticle3D(..., additive)` selects the mode (embers/sparks additive,
  smoke/dust alpha). The village bonfire now billows a gray smoke column above its glowing embers —
  both blend modes in one frame, verified on lavapipe.
- [x] **M33 — Font text alignment**: `Font::drawTextCentered` (uses `textWidth`); village's win
  text is now properly centered (was hand-offset by ~220px) and orbs' `centerText` routes through
  it (removing the duplicated math). Verified: orbs' title screen and village win text center.

**Iteration 6 complete** (smoke particles + text alignment).

### Iteration 7 — "Tooling & dynamic geometry" (in progress)
Evaluation: no visual debug-draw (wireframe) despite having a stats overlay; meshes are static
(no vertex animation). This iteration:
- [x] **M34 — Wireframe debug mode**: a second `VK_POLYGON_MODE_LINE` mesh pipeline toggled via
  `Renderer::setWireframe` (built only when the GPU exposes `fillModeNonSolid`, enabled on the
  logical device; silently stays filled otherwise). `world` toggles it with **F4** and accepts
  `--wireframe` at launch. Verified on lavapipe: boxes and the sphere render as their edge/triangle
  lattice while the 2D HUD stays solid.
- [x] **M35 — Dynamic meshes + water**: `Renderer::createDynamicMesh` + `updateMesh` re-stream a
  mesh's vertices every frame. Each dynamic mesh holds one host-visible vertex buffer *per frame in
  flight*; `updateMesh` writes the current frame's buffer (selected after the fence wait in
  `beginFrame`) so a write never races a frame still reading. The new `water` demo animates a 64×64
  grid with four summed sine trains, deriving per-vertex normals analytically so the sunlit crests
  and shadowed troughs respond to the ripples; distance fog fades it into the sky. Verified on
  lavapipe: two frames 2s apart differ by ~600k pixels (genuinely animating), no validation errors.

**Iteration 7 complete** (wireframe debug draw + dynamic meshes/water).

### Iteration 8 — "Debug visualization & materials" (in progress)
Evaluation: the only debug-draw was all-or-nothing mesh wireframe — no way to draw arbitrary
world-space lines (colliders, light ranges, paths, gizmos); and meshes could only be lit, nothing
could self-glow to feed bloom. This iteration:
- [x] **M36 — Debug line/shape renderer**: a `DebugDraw` renderer draws world-space colored lines
  (`Renderer::drawLine`) and AABBs (`drawAabb`) via a `LINE_LIST` pipeline with per-frame-in-flight
  vertex buffers, alpha-blended and depth-tested (geometry occludes them) inside the scene pass.
  `world` overlays every collision box in green with **F5** (or `--colliders`). Verified on lavapipe:
  the green boxes wrap each block exactly, confirming colliders match geometry; no validation errors.
- [x] **M37 — Emissive material term**: `Renderer::drawMeshEmissive` adds a per-draw emissive RGB
  (four more push-constant floats) to the fragment result *after* lighting and *before* fog, so an
  object self-illuminates and feeds bloom. `world` enables soft bloom and draws its pickups as
  pulsing emissive gold. Verified on lavapipe: the pickups glow vivid gold with a bloom halo while
  the (below-threshold) scene is unaffected; no validation errors.

**Iteration 8 complete** (debug line/collider draw + emissive materials).

### Iteration 9 — "HDR & game feel" (in progress)
Evaluation: the scene target was 8-bit LDR, so emissive/bloom clipped at 1.0 and there was no
tonemap; and pickups/hits had no camera feedback. This iteration:
- [x] **M38 — HDR scene target + ACES tonemap**: the offscreen scene color (and MSAA color) is now
  `R16G16B16A16_SFLOAT`, so lighting/emissive/bloom can exceed 1.0. The composite pass applies an
  exposure multiply + Narkowicz ACES tonemap (`Renderer::setTonemap`), off by default so 2D/3D apps
  are a faithful passthrough. Verified: orbs (2D) and cube (3D) unchanged with tonemap off; `water`
  with an over-bright sun rolls its sunlit crests off smoothly instead of clipping; no validation
  errors on the format change.
- [x] **M39 — Screen-shake / camera juice**: `maz::game::Shake` is a header-only trauma-based shake
  (applied amount = trauma², decaying linearly) whose offset/rotation are pure functions of
  (trauma, time) from layered sines — no RNG, deterministic. `world` adds trauma on each pickup and
  offsets the camera eye (restored afterward so collision sees the true position); the 2D HUD is
  unaffected. Verified on lavapipe: with shake pinned the frame-to-frame delta is ~468k pixels vs
  ~6.6k for a static camera (~70×), and the shaken frame renders cleanly; no validation errors.

**Iteration 9 complete** (HDR scene target + ACES tonemap; trauma-based camera shake).

### Iteration 10 — "Broadphase & bloom quality" (in progress)
Evaluation: collision tested every solid per move (O(n)), and bloom was a single-pass in-composite
blur (narrow, aliased at higher strengths). This iteration:
- [x] **M40 — Spatial grid broadphase**: `maz::game::SpatialGrid` buckets static colliders into an
  X/Z hash of square cells (Y ignored in bucketing; narrow-phase overlap is still full 3D). A
  `slideMove(pos, delta, half, grid)` overload gathers only the solids sharing the swept box's cells
  (deduped by a per-query stamp). `world` collides against the grid and draws occupied cells in cyan
  with **F6** (`--grid`). Verified on lavapipe: the grid overlay tiles the block field, movement and
  pickups still work (autopilot collects), no validation errors.
- [x] **M41 — Separable downsampled bloom**: a `BloomChain` runs three half-res fullscreen passes —
  bright-pass + 2×2 downsample of the HDR sceneColor, then a separable horizontal and vertical
  9-tap Gaussian (ping-pong between two float targets). The composite samples the blurred result
  (a second sampler) and adds it scaled by strength; the in-shader single-pass bloom is gone. Wider,
  smoother glow at lower cost (O(2n) taps, ¼ the pixels). Verified on lavapipe: orbs (2D) and cube
  (3D) pixel-identical with bloom off, water/world show a broader soft glow with bloom on, no
  validation errors across the new render passes.

**Iteration 10 complete** (spatial-grid broadphase; separable downsampled bloom).

### Iteration 11 — "Materials & settings" (in progress)
Evaluation: meshes were purely diffuse (no glossy highlights), and graphics/quality choices weren't
persisted. This iteration:
- [x] **M42 — Specular/roughness material**: `Renderer::Material` (albedo, normal, emissive,
  roughness, specular) + `drawMeshMaterial`. mesh.frag adds a Blinn-Phong sun highlight gated by the
  specular strength (packed into the spare `camPos.w`) and roughness (spare `emissive.w`); matte
  defaults (specular 0) leave every existing draw byte-identical. The `cube` demo opts in and shows a
  glossy highlight sweeping across its faces. Verified on lavapipe: highlight visible in the spin
  montage, orbs/matte unchanged, no validation errors.
- [x] **M43 — Persist graphics settings**: `world` loads bloom/tonemap/wireframe from a
  `settings.ini` (via `KeyValueStore` at `platform::prefPath`) and re-applies them on launch; F7
  (bloom), F8 (tonemap), and F4 (wireframe) toggle and immediately save, and a HUD line shows the
  live state. Verified on lavapipe: an externally-written `bloom=0/tonemap=1/wireframe=1` is loaded
  and applied (wireframe scene, tonemap look, no bloom) with the HUD matching.

**Iteration 11 complete** (specular/roughness material; persistent graphics settings).

### Iteration 12 — "Shadow & post polish" (in progress)
Evaluation: shadows used a hard 2×2 PCF (blocky edges), and post-processing had no color grading.
This iteration:
- [x] **M44 — Soft shadows**: `shadowFactor()` widened to a 5×5 PCF kernel (25 taps at 1.5-texel
  spread) for a soft penumbra. Shader-only; every shadowed 3D app benefits. Verified on lavapipe:
  the `model` house casts a soft self-shadow with no blocky edges, no validation errors.
- [x] **M45 — Vignette + color grade**: the composite gained an opt-in grade (soft vignette +
  saturation + contrast) via a second push-constant vec4 and `Renderer::setColorGrade`; off by
  default, so bloom-off/tonemap-off apps stay byte-identical. VILLAGE QUEST wears a cinematic grade
  that deepens at night. Verified on lavapipe: the village shows darkened corners + richer color,
  orbs (grade off) unchanged, no validation errors.

**Iteration 12 complete** (soft shadows; composite color grade).

### Iteration 13 — "Lens polish & navigation" (in progress)
- [x] **M46 — Chromatic aberration**: an opt-in radial RGB split in the composite (third push vec4,
  `Renderer::setChromaticAberration`); off by default so other apps are unchanged. VILLAGE QUEST
  enables a gentle amount. Verified on lavapipe: clear red/cyan fringing on the corner HUD text and
  edge silhouettes, no validation errors.
- [x] **M47 — World minimap**: `world` draws a top-down corner radar — a translucent panel with the
  blocks (gray), uncollected pickups (gold), and the player (cyan) plotted from world X/Z into the
  panel via 2D sprites. Verified on lavapipe: the radar mirrors the block field with the player and
  pickups placed correctly, 3D scene unaffected, no validation errors.

**Iteration 13 complete** (chromatic aberration; world minimap).

### Iteration 14 — "Grain & particle forces" (in progress)
- [x] **M48 — Film grain**: opt-in animated hashed noise added at the end of the composite
  (`Renderer::setFilmGrain(strength, time)`, packed into the third push vec4); off by default.
  VILLAGE QUEST adds a gentle moving grain. Verified on lavapipe: clear speckle across a cropped sky
  region, no validation errors.
- [x] **M49 — Particle attractor**: `fx::ParticleSystem::setAttractor(x, y, strength, swirl)` adds a
  radial pull toward a point plus a perpendicular swirl each update (a vortex); `clearAttractor`
  restores free flight. ORB RUN's title screen emits an ambient cloud that the attractor swirls into
  an orbiting vortex behind the logo (cleared when a round starts). Verified on lavapipe: the title
  shows a clear particle vortex, gameplay bursts unaffected, no validation errors.

**Iteration 14 complete** (film grain; particle attractor/vortex).

### Iteration 15 — "Foundations: automated testing" (in progress)
Self-directed evaluation: the engine's biggest *process* gap is that everything was verified by
hand (screenshots) or by "exits 0" smoke tests — no automated protection against logic or visual
regressions. Highest-leverage fix before more features: real testing.
- [x] **M50 — Unit test suite**: a dependency-free `CHECK`/`CHECK_NEAR` runner (`tests/unit/main.cpp`
  → `maz_unit_tests`, wired into ctest) covering `math` (Vulkan perspective Y-flip, ortho2D mapping,
  vector identities), `game::Collision` (AABB overlap, slideMove stop + slide), `game::SpatialGrid`
  (gather locality, grid vs vector slideMove parity, occupied-cell count), `ecs::World`
  (create/destroy/id-reuse, add/get/has/remove, each/view iteration), `game::Shake` (trauma clamp +
  decay), and the `fx` particle attractor. 44 checks, all passing; ctest is now 10/10.
- [x] **M51 — Golden-image regression harness**: `tools/golden.sh` renders each app on lavapipe
  under Xvfb and diffs against committed references (`tests/golden/`) using a **per-app RMSE
  tolerance** — tight (0.03) for deterministic scenes like `cube`/`water`, looser (0.20–0.22) for the
  time-animated `world`/`village` — so it fails on structural breaks (broken pass, wrong colours,
  missing geometry) without false-positiving on animation jitter. Integrated into ctest (self-skips
  without a GPU). Verified both directions: clean runs pass (11/11 ctest), and a deliberately altered
  cube texture is caught (RMSE 0.039 > 0.03). Finding along the way: the flat first attempt missed
  the change while false-positiving on `world`, which is what drove the per-app thresholds.

**Iteration 15 complete** (unit tests + golden-image regression harness — the engine now has
automated logic and visual regression protection).

### Iteration 16 — "Rendering correctness" (in progress)
Self-directed: the biggest backlog items (material-UBO refactor, instancing) are large shared-render
refactors best given their own iterations. This iteration takes two foundational *correctness* wins
that the new test infra can verify rigorously.
- [x] **M52 — Texture mipmaps**: `VulkanTexture::create` now allocates a full mip chain and blit-
  generates it (`vkCmdBlitImage`, linear downsample, per-level layout transitions). The sampler uses
  `minFilter LINEAR` + `mipmapMode LINEAR` (trilinear) so minified/distant surfaces anti-alias, while
  `magFilter` stays NEAREST so near surfaces and the 2D UI keep their crisp look. Verified on
  lavapipe: scene3d's distant checker floor is smooth instead of shimmering, no validation errors;
  golden references re-recorded (intended change), ctest 11/11.
- [x] **M53 — Ray vs AABB queries**: `game::raycastAabb` (slab method, handles ray-inside and
  parallel-slab cases, respects maxDist) and `game::raycast` (nearest hit over a list, returns the
  struck index). Pure logic → 12 new unit checks (56 total). `world` casts a forward ray from the
  camera each frame and outlines the looked-at block in orange via the debug-line renderer — a worked
  targeting/interaction example. Verified: unit tests pass, the static-spawn frame shows the aimed
  block highlighted, no validation errors, ctest 11/11.

**Iteration 16 complete** (texture mipmaps; ray/AABB queries + look-at targeting).

Later: material/uniform system (retire push-constant packing), instanced mesh rendering, transparency
depth-sorting, texture mipmaps, skeletal animation, retained UI, asset manager, cross-platform CI,
a deterministic hold-frame screenshot mode to tighten golden tolerances.

# Closing the Godot Gaps — the Work Plan (everything except ecosystem)

This is the executable plan for `GODOT_GAPS.md`. The user asked to close **every gap except the
ecosystem section** (§8 of `GODOT_GAPS.md`). This document turns the remaining gaps into an ordered
queue of concrete, buildable milestones that the autonomous milestone loop works through one at a
time, newest progress tracked in the scratchpad log and `GODOT_PARITY.md`.

## The honest constraint (read this first)

This build machine has **no GPU, no audio device, and no VR/console hardware**. That splits every
item into three verifiability tiers, and each milestone below is tagged with one:

- **[VERIFIABLE HERE]** — pure CPU/logic/parsing/tooling. Can be written *and* unit-tested to the
  same "N checks, 0 failures" bar as the rest of the engine. The bulk of the list is this.
- **[CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]** — real code can be written and compiled here, and its CPU
  parts tested, but the visible/audible result (a lit frame, a played sound) can only be confirmed on
  a machine with a real GPU/audio device. These are honestly marked "written, not visually verified."
- **[NEEDS YOUR HARDWARE/TOOLCHAIN]** — cannot be meaningfully done in this sandbox at all (console
  SDKs under NDA, a physical VR headset, an app-store signing pipeline). These are documented and
  deferred, never claimed as done.

Nothing is ever marked complete on this branch unless it passed real verification. Where a thing can
only be written blind, the docs say exactly that.

## Queue — grouped by `GODOT_GAPS.md` section (ecosystem §8 intentionally excluded)

### §4 Import formats — mostly [VERIFIABLE HERE] (pure parsers)
- [x] **Collada `.dae` mesh import** (`render::parseCollada`) — DONE (M497). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **PLY mesh import** (ASCII + binary) — `render::parsePly` — DONE (M498). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **STL mesh import** (ASCII + binary) — `render::parseStl` / `loadStl` — DONE (M509); auto-detects encoding,
  per-face normals with winding-based fallback. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **OBJ material library `.mtl`** — `render::parseMtl` / `loadMtl` / `findMaterial` — DONE (M510); the material
  side of the OBJ importer (colors, shininess, transparency, texture-map paths). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **DDS texture decode** (DXT1/DXT3/DXT5 = BC1/BC2/BC3) — `render::decodeDds` / `loadDds` — DONE (M511); CPU
  S3TC block unpack to an editable RGBA8 Image (distinct from the Ktx2 GPU-upload path). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **half-precision float (float16) conversion** — `math::halfToFloat` / `floatToHalf` — DONE (M512); the
  IEEE 754 half format underpinning HDR image storage, glTF quantized accessors, and GPU vertex compression
  (round-to-nearest-even, exhaustively verified). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **spherical-harmonic irradiance probes** (`math::ShL2` / `shBasis` / `shIrradiance`) — DONE (M513); the
  order-2 SH ambient/light-probe representation Godot bakes into LightmapGI (project radiance -> 9 RGB
  coeffs -> clamped-cosine irradiance). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **SNORM/UNORM fixed-point packing** (`math::packUnorm8/16` / `packSnorm8/16` + unpack) — DONE (M514);
  the quantization layer of vertex/attribute compression (Khronos GL/Vulkan norm encoding). Composes with
  octahedronEncode to store a normal in two uint16s the way Godot's compressed mesh format does. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **BC1/DXT1 texture ENCODE** (`render::encodeBc1Block` / `encodeDdsBc1` / `saveDdsBc1`) — DONE (M515);
  the inverse of the M511 decoder — the CPU texture-compression step Godot's editor runs on import
  (RGBA -> block-compressed .dds, farthest-pair range-fit endpoints). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **BC3/DXT5 texture ENCODE** (`render::encodeBc3AlphaBlock` / `encodeDdsBc3` / `saveDdsBc3`) — DONE (M517);
  adds the alpha channel DXT1 can't store (sprites/UI/foliage), 8-value interpolated alpha + reused color block. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **TGA image decode** — ALREADY PRESENT (`render::decodeTga`, `ImageCodecTga.hpp`). No work needed.
- [x] **BMP image decode** — ALREADY PRESENT (`render::decodeBmp`, `ImageCodecBmp.hpp`). No work needed.
- [x] **DEFLATE / zlib inflate** (`io::inflateRaw` / `io::zlibInflate`) — DONE (M499); prerequisite for PNG. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **gzip (.gz) container decode** (`io::gunzip`) — DONE (M516); RFC 1952 framing over inflateRaw + CRC-32/ISIZE
  verify (reuses core::crc32). Godot's FileAccess gzip mode. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **PNG decode** (`render::decodePng` / `loadPng`) — DONE (M500); chunks + all 5 filters + gray/RGB/RGBA/palette.
  **Adam7 interlacing added M508** (7-pass sparse sub-grids unfiltered + scattered). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **Ogg Vorbis / MP3 decode to PCM** — large, pure-CPU decoders feeding the existing mixer. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **Font fallback chains** (`ui::FontFallback`) — DONE (M501); per-codepoint resolution + per-font runs. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **FBX import** — binary + ASCII FBX is large and semi-proprietary; do the geometry subset. [VERIFIABLE HERE]

### §7 Text / UI / localization depth — [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **Unicode BiDi runs + base direction** — ALREADY PRESENT (`ui::bidiRuns` / `baseDirection`, `TextServer.hpp`).
- [x] **Line-break opportunities** — ALREADY PRESENT (`ui::lineBreakOpportunities`, `TextServer.hpp`).
- [ ] **Basic complex-script shaping hooks** (mark positioning, ligature substitution tables). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **Localization tooling** — POT/PO extract + import beyond the current CSV tables. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **Video container/codec decode** to frames (display is GPU-side). [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]

### §6 Scripting & language — [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **C# / .NET-style second binding** OR deepen the existing script VM toward GDScript-grade tooling
  (autocomplete data, doc tooltips, live debug protocol). [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **Stable C-ABI extension interface** (a GDExtension analog) so native modules load without
  recompiling the engine. [VERIFIABLE HERE]

### §2 Platforms & export — mixed
- [x] **ProjectSettings / project.godot manifest** (`core::ProjectSettings`) — DONE (M518); typed project-wide
  settings (name, main scene, window size) with Godot dotted keys + sectioned save/load round-trip. Foundation
  for the editor + export. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **Desktop export/packaging** — extend `tools/package.sh` into a real per-OS bundler
  (assets + launcher + config). [VERIFIABLE HERE] (the packaging logic; running the packaged game is manual)
- [ ] **Web/WASM build target** via Emscripten for the headless/logic core. [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]
  (needs Emscripten present to actually emit `.wasm`)
- [ ] **Android / iOS export** — build scripts + input/sensor shims. [NEEDS YOUR HARDWARE/TOOLCHAIN]
  (Android SDK/NDK, Xcode, devices)
- [ ] **Console export** — [NEEDS YOUR HARDWARE/TOOLCHAIN] (NDA SDKs; cannot be done in a public sandbox)
- [ ] **XR/OpenXR** — runtime bindings can be stubbed; real use is [NEEDS YOUR HARDWARE/TOOLCHAIN]

### §5 High-end 3D rendering — [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]
All of these need a live GPU to *see*, but the CPU-side data structures, bakers, and math are testable.
- [x] **Lightmap baker** (`render::bakeLightmap`) — DONE (M502); direct light + hard shadows, bake fully
  VERIFIABLE HERE (sampling the map is GPU-side). Follow-up: bounce GI + UV-atlas unwrap. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **Decal projection math** (`render::projectDecal`) — DONE (M503); oriented-box UV + normal fade. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **Volumetric-fog evaluation** (`render::fogOpticalDepth` / `fogFactor` / `applyFog`) — DONE (M504);
  analytic Beer-Lambert + exponential height falloff, fully VERIFIABLE HERE (GPU froxel raymarch is separate).
- [x] **Occlusion culling** — ALREADY PRESENT (`render::Occlusion.hpp`, screen-space coverage buffer).
- [x] **Mesh LOD selection** — ALREADY PRESENT (`render::MeshLod.hpp`, `LodChain::select` by projected pixels).
- [x] **Cubemap direction/UV mapping** (`render::directionToCube` / `cubeToDirection`) — DONE (M506); the
  sampling math for reflection probes, skyboxes, and IBL. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [x] **Reflection-probe influence + box projection** (`render::ReflectionProbe`) — DONE (M507); blend
  weights + parallax-corrected sample direction. The cubemap *capture* is still a GPU pass. [VERIFIABLE HERE]
- [ ] **SSR/SSIL passes**, **GPU particles + collision**, reflection-probe cubemap **capture** pass.
  Shaders/passes written & compiled here; visual confirmation is on your GPU. [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]
- [x] **3D navigation mesh pathfinding** (`game::NavMesh3D`) — DONE (M505); path query + surface height over
  supplied walkable polygons (reuses the 2D corridor A*+funnel). Follow-up: bake from geometry + dynamic
  obstacles. [VERIFIABLE HERE]

### §3 Editor as an application — [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]
The editor *logic* already exists (`maz/editor/`). Turning it into a running GUI app (dockable panels,
live viewport, visual shader/animation/theme editors, debugger GUI) requires a GPU to render the editor
itself, so it is written here and run on your machine. [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]

### §1 Foundational — the honest core
- [ ] **Renderer proven on real hardware** — [NEEDS YOUR HARDWARE/TOOLCHAIN] (a GPU). This is the one
  gap only your machine can close; the code exists and is what everything in §5/§3 builds on.
- [ ] **Audio device output path** — SDL audio callback wiring is [CODE HERE / SEE IT ON YOUR MACHINE]
  (compiles here; a speaker confirms it).
- [x] **Networking transport + reliability** — real UDP sockets (`maz::net::UdpSocket`, portable
  POSIX/Winsock; `tests/net/loopback.cpp`) AND `maz::net::ReliableChannel` wiring the ack layer onto them
  for reliable, in-order message delivery across a **40%-loss link** (`tests/net/reliable.cpp`, ctest
  `net_reliable`: 50/50 in order). [VERIFIABLE HERE — DONE]. Remaining: secure (DTLS) transport,
  WebSocket/WebRTC for browsers, and a true cross-machine soak on the owner's two machines (manual).

## How the loop uses this

Each iteration: pick the next unchecked **[VERIFIABLE HERE]** item first (highest confidence, real
verification), implement it, unit-test it to green, document it, commit, and check it off here. Items in
the other two tiers are taken when they are the best remaining value, and are shipped with an explicit
"written / not verified here" note so nothing is over-claimed. The ecosystem section (§8) is skipped by
request.
